To run our app whilst we are building it can become quite tedious.
We will have to stop, start, refresh, etc... everytime we make a change to the code, or even just some html.
Therefore, we employ the use of a package installed through 'npm', or Node Package Manager.
The package is called Nodemon, and is useful in many ways throughout the development process. Install String: npm install nodemon (then npm install -g nodemon for global use).
To run scripts with nodemon, you can see package.json for the list of executables.
The most common we will run is 'nodemon start', which is currently configured to run app.js.
The use of nodemon currently is that whenever a change in the code is detected, nodemon will automatically restart our server for us.
